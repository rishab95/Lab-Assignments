Image Processing Lab Experiments

  Gray to binary.  
  Image Compliment.  
  Rotate an image by 90,180,270 anticlockwise.  
  Mirror image both vertically and horizontally.  
  Zoom/Shrink the image by scaling factor s(user input) , using bilinear interpolation.  
  Crop the image. Input the coordinates of cropped image from user.  
  Rotation at any angle.   
  Log transform.  
  Power law/gamma transform.  
  Contrast stretching.  
  Bit plane slicing.  
    Image reconstruction using less planes.    
    Image steganography.    
    Watermark embedding and tampering detection.    
  Histogram equalization and specification.
  Filtering (mask size is user input).
    Box filter.
    Weighted filter given by h(x,y)=max(|x|,|y|).
    Gaussian filter ( is user input).
  Sharpening filters (take mask size odd).
    Laplacian filter.
    Gradient operators of Prewitt and Sobel.
  Unsharp masking, to obtain blurred image use gaussian filter of size 5x5 and =3.
  Fourier spectrum of input image.
    Un-centered.
    Centered.
  Log transformation on centered.
    Fourier transform of input image and compare your values with inbuilt function fft.
  Determine whether the reconstructed image (by using fourier transform) is similar to the original input image.
  Generate following noise.
    Uniform noise.
    Gaussian noise.
    Erlang noise.
    Exponential noise.
    Rayleigh noise.
